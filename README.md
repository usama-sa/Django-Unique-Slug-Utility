# Django Unique Slug Generator ðŸ”—

A reusable Django utility for generating **unique slugs** from any model field â€” including nested or related fields via `ForeignKey`, `OneToOneField`, etc. Handles slug conflicts gracefully by appending random characters **only when needed**, making your URLs clean, consistent, and human-readable.
